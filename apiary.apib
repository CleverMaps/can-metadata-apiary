# Metadata 2.0

Draft of new metadata for redesigned CleverAnalytics Platform

## TODO
* Is it necessary to use complete URLs for datasets, fcSelectors, featureCollections etc.?
* Find out how to compute group aggregations
* Design popUp metadata
* Design featureCollection metadata
* Remove `groups.json`?
* How to find out polygon granularity?
* How to decide what should be searched?

## PopUp

REMOVED popUp metadata.

PopUp content is automatically prepared according to feature `dataset`, selected `dashboard` and `indicator`:
* **Title and Subtitle** from `dataset.properties.featureTitle`
* **Main metric** from selected `indicator` property. Special position or first item in grid.
* **Other metric grid** some other metrics in grid selected from `dashboard.content.indicator`

## MapOptions [/{project}/mapOptions]

### Get mapOptions [GET]

Get default project mapOptions. It can be overridden per view, but you're encouraged not to do so.

#### TODO
* Move it to `/project` resource?

#### Changes
* REMOVED `maxBounds`
* EDITED `center`, `zoom`

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "center": [49.8, 16],
            "zoom": 8,
            "minZoom": 0,
            "maxZoom": 18,
            "tileLayer": "mapbox"
        }

## Project NEW [/{project}/project]

### Get project [GET]

Get default project settings. Other than `bootstrap/project`

#### TODO
* Move `viewCategories` here?

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "language": "en",
            "dataInfo": "All views use<br>current census data."
        }

## Datasets [/{project}/datasets]

### Get datasets [GET]

Get all project datasets.

#### TODO
* Is DWH dataset `searchBy` enabled?
* Move somewhere `title` to `properties`?
* Move `searchBy` to `properties` or define searchable fields in `ref.properties`?
* Could be `crs` other than 4326? Move to `ref`?
* How to make aggregations with DWH? Formerly `aggregation`
* Automatic DWH geometries? `[x, y]` for points, `[x_min...y_max]` for polygons and lines.
* Review new dataset type Vector Tiles

#### Changes
* EDITED `properties.includingVat` and `properties.period` removed in favor of `properties.attribution`
* REMOVED `properties.icon` was used for search categories. Style from featureCollections will be used instead.
* ADDED `properties.emptyViewMessage` message displayed if feature has no dashboard
* ADDED `ref.size` recommended page size
* REMOVED `ref.type==='wfs'` replaced with Vector Tiles
* ADDED `ref.type==='vt'` new Vector Tiles dataset type
